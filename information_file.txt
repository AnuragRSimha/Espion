================ ABOUT ESPION AND A GUIDE TO USE IT ==================

WARNING: The use of this tool is strictly for only benevolent 
or educational purposes. Any malevolent intention or misuse of Espion 
could certainly put your life at risk. Henceforth, use this tool 
cautiously.

What is Espion?
Espion (Spy in French) is a bijou keylogger tool to capture any key 
that the user on a target machine presses on his/her keyboard. Espion 
supports 1:M connection. 1:M is a notation for one server and many 
clients.

What are keyloggers?
Keyloggers are spyware tools (hence the name, Espion) that capture
'keystrokes' on a target computer and reflect the captured data in 
real-time and/or keep it stored in a log file.  

Where to use Espion?
The design of Espion supports only a local network. Rooms, office 
cabins, and other such places are endorsed.

How to use Espion?
Follow these steps:
1. Confirm the victim machine(s) and the attacker machine.
2. On the attacker machine, run the generator program first.
	Syntax: python generator.py
3. Enter all the details asked for into the prompt.
4. Remember the IP address and the port number that's designated.
5. Once again, on the attacker machine, run the listener program.
	Syntax: python espion.py <IP> <PORT>
6. Now, head to the victim machine.
7. Run the program titled 'victim.py' over there (on the victim machine).
	Syntax: python victim.py
(Optional: Connect another victim to the attacker machine.)
8. Type anything on the target machine(s). Then monitor/observe the 
output received on the attacker machine.

NOTE: Espion is not OS-specific.

All the details are stored in a keystroke log file on the same directory
where espion.py program was running. Remember to terminate the execution
of that program before browsing the log file. It's titled as 
'Keystroke log file (<current date>).txt'.
